This script will install utilities required to build and install sys161 and
os161, and install them on your local machine. It will ask you if you want to
add the utilities to your path, and if you want to remove the archive files
after installation.

The script will fail at any point if there are build errors. It will not
download the archive files necessary if they still exist in the current
working directory.

This script will install the programs to a subdirectory sys161 in the current
directory, and leave the archives extracted in the current working directory.
